# Module 3: Working with Components in React 18

Author: Peter Kellner

This module is all about the starting code that will be used going
forward in this course. The reason there is only one clip listed (m3-clip-000) 
is that no code is changed through all the clips.  This also is the same as m4-clip-000 meaning
this code is the starting point for module 4, Global State Sharing and React Context
